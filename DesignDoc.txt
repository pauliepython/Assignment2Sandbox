Rough Design:
- Check config file against the backup dir, if a file in the config is not in the dir, back it up
- To backup the file, File IO to add file name to YAML config file
- Check timestamp of files in config
- If the modification date is within 60 seconds, backup file to backup location
- Append backup name so as not to overwrite (add timestamp to name)
- Add input to config file from cmd line
- Get timemachine to run every 60 seconds via cron



Design Decisions:
- Use YAML for config file



Failure Modes:
-



Testing:
-


Assumptions:
